The following discussion will give an explanation of the various ways in which investment is related or differentiated from the financial and economic sense and how speculation differs from investment.
It must be clearly established that investment involves long-term commitment.
From the point of view of people who invest their funds, they are the suppliers of ‘Capital’ and in their view, investment is a commitment of a person’s funds to derive future income in the form of interest, dividends, rent, premiums, pension benefits or the appreciation of the value of their principal capital.
Most investments are considered to be transfers of financial assets from one person to another.
The nature of investment in the financial sense differs from its use in the economic sense.
The term investment implies the formation of new and productive capital in the form of new construction, new producers’ durable equipment such as plant and equipment.
The financial and economic meaning of investment are related to each other because investment is a part of the savings of individuals which flow into the capital market either directly or through institutions, divided in ‘new’ and second hand capital financing.
